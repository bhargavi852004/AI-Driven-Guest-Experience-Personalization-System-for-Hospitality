# AI-Powered Guest Experience Personalization System for Hospitality

## Project Overview
This project develops an **AI-driven system** to enhance hospitality guest experiences using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA. The system analyzes guest feedback, monitors sentiment trends, and dynamically personalizes recommendations for dining, activities, and amenities. By integrating real-time alerts for service teams, the solution ensures adaptive, tailored experiences that evolve with guest preferences during their stay.

## Key Outcomes
- **Personalized recommendations** for dining, activities, and amenities based on guest behavior analysis.
- **Real-time sentiment monitoring** to proactively address guest feedback.
- **Increased guest satisfaction** through dynamic personalization.
- **Automated alerts for staff** to resolve issues and optimize service delivery.

## Repository Structure & Milestones
The project is structured into **four milestones**, each building upon the previous one to develop a robust AI-powered guest experience system.

### **Milestone 1: Building & Evaluating a Machine Learning Model for Favorite Dish Prediction**
**Objective:** Predict the favorite dish of a customer based on their dining preferences and behavior.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Preparation** â€“ Loaded the dataset, split it into feature extraction, training, and testing sets based on time-based logic.
2. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Computed customer-level and cuisine-level features.
3. **Data Integration** â€“ Merged engineered features into the training and testing datasets.
4. **Encoding & Model Training** â€“ Applied one-hot encoding for categorical data and trained an **XGBoost Classifier** for dish prediction.
5. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Assessed model performance using accuracy, log loss, and feature importance analysis.

âœ… **Outcome:** Developed an XGBoost model for predicting a guestâ€™s favorite dish with **0.18 accuracy**.

### **Milestone 2: Guest Preference Modeling & Personalized Recommendation System**
**Objective:** Develop a recommendation engine to suggest personalized amenities and activities for guests.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Processing** â€“ Cleaned and preprocessed guest booking history, activity participation, and amenity usage data.
2. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Extracted features like frequency of activity participation, preferred times, and past spending patterns.
3. **Collaborative Filtering** â€“ Implemented **User-Based & Item-Based Filtering** to recommend relevant activities based on guest preferences.
4. **Content-Based Filtering** â€“ Used **TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity** to generate activity recommendations based on textual guest preferences.
5. **Hybrid Recommendation Model** â€“ Combined collaborative and content-based approaches for improved accuracy.

âœ… **Outcome:** Built a **personalized recommendation system** that adapts to guest preferences and historical behaviors.

### **Milestone 3: Real-Time Sentiment Monitoring & Guest Feedback Analysis**
**Objective:** Analyze guest reviews using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to monitor sentiment trends and generate real-time alerts.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** â€“ Loaded and cleaned guest feedback data, tokenized text, and removed stopwords.
2. **Sentiment Analysis** â€“ Used **VADER** for rule-based sentiment scoring and **BERT-based sentiment classification** for deeper insights.
3. **Trend Monitoring & Insights** â€“ Tracked sentiment over time, identified top positive/negative topics using **TF-IDF & LDA Topic Modeling**.
4. **Integration with Hospitality System** â€“ Created automated alerts for staff when negative sentiment was detected.

âœ… **Outcome:** Implemented **real-time guest sentiment tracking**, allowing proactive issue resolution and improved guest satisfaction.

### **Milestone 4: AI-Driven Chatbot for Guest Interaction & Service Requests**
**Objective:** Develop a chatbot powered by **GPT-4 & LLaMA** to assist guests with queries, booking requests, and recommendations.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Conversational AI Design** â€“ Defined chatbot intents, responses, and dialogue flows.
2. **LLM Integration** â€“ Integrated OpenAI GPT & Meta LLaMA models to enhance conversational accuracy.
3. **Personalization Layer** â€“ Fetched guest preferences in real-time to provide **context-aware responses**.
4. **Multi-Channel Deployment** â€“ Enabled chatbot interactions through **web, mobile, and voice interfaces**.

âœ… **Outcome:** Deployed an **AI-powered guest assistant chatbot**, enhancing user engagement and streamlining service requests.
